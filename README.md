# O terr√≠vel jogo da Perna Cabeluda

Repository: https://gitlab.com/Andre-LA/o-terrivel-jogo-da-perna-cabeluda

This is a experimental game ;)

# Dependencies

To build and run this game, is necessary to install the following dependencies:

* Luarocks: https://luarocks.org/ (used by Nelua, but maybe I'll use it too)
* Nelua: https://nelua.io/ (the programming language in which that game is written)
* raylib-nelua: https://libregit.org/Andre-LA/raylib-nelua or https://github.com/Andre-LA/raylib-nelua-mirror (raylib wrapper to Nelua)
* Raylib: https://www.raylib.com/ (use the version use by raylib-nelua)
* GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/ (used by raylib, theoretically raylib already ships it, but for some reason I needed to install it)


This projects uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) as version control system.

# How to build and run

Just run the command ``nelua main.nelua`` to run the game.
You may want to use the ``-r`` to build it in release mode, which compiles using more otimizations.

# Why is the game and some parts of the Wiki in portuguese?

This is a personal and experimental project, unfortunately I'm not proficient in english and takes a lot of time to translate a text to english. The code, however, is in english.

However, english translations will be available in the future.
